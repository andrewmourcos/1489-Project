# 1489-Project

A computational program that determines all the ways to use 4 numbers (1, 4, 8, 9 for example) and 4 operations (+, -, /, *) to determine all the arrangements to get numbers 1-100.

This 1489 concept started as a math project in grade 7 (to get used to arithmetic I guess...) and now (4 years later), I'm making a program that could have given me all the solutions using brute-force (computing EVERY possibility).

Enjoy :)
