# 1489-Project

This '1489' concept started as a math project in grade 7 (to get used to arithmetic I guess...). It consists of using the numbers 1, 4, 8, 9 and operations +, -, /, * to get an expression that satisfies all numbers from 1-100. This long task required a lot of trial and error and TIME. Now (4 years later), I'm challenging myself to make a program that could've saved me a lot of effort back then ;)
