# 1489-Project

This '1489' concept started as a math project in grade 7 (to get used to arithmetic I guess...). It consists of using the numbers 1, 4, 8, 9 and operations +, -, /, * to make 100 expressions that satisfy all numbers from 1-100. This long task required a lot of trial and error and TIME. Now (4 years later), I'm challenging myself to make a program that could've saved me a lot of effort back then ;)

Here are the rules for this project:
- Write math expressions that equal all integers from 1 to 100
- you may only use the numbers 1,4,8 and 9
- you may only use each number ONCE in each expression
- you may not use 2 digit numbers (ex: putting 1 and 4 together does not count as 14...)
- you may use any combination of the 4 basic math operations (+, -, /, *)

What's left to fix:
    1) Adding square root and factorial (I need to check the rules first... ;) )
    2) Adding normal-polish-notation
